In the past we used BCRYPT for this mostly but it introduces a rather big computational overhead.
The argument is that BCRYPT is useful for protecting user-chosen passwords because they tend to be simple, predictable, reused and longlived. So the passwords stored in CMS (if any) will remain in BCRYPT.
However, the temporary authentications generate ad hoc secrets that are generally severely limited in use. Speed is -at that point- more important.

If at some point our database gets hacked, we can easily reset all the temporary authentications without major issues.
