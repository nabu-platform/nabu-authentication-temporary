One of the primary usecases for temporary tokens is to download files.
In this case the token will be in the URL, which is why we don't use the alias as an id. 


Currently there is no support yet for the newly added "id" to the token.
Ideally we would have the user id in there.
To be checked if and how this can be achieved.

Note that the correlation id is NOT the user id!!
